sublime-beancount
=================

Bits and pieces to facilitate accounting with [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/) using Sublime Text.

Currently, just a syntax definition and a build system.

The build system runs "bean-check" on the current file, and  works with "Build system: Automatic", and line navigation works.
